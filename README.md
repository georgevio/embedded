Welcome to our experimental code repository focused on the ESP32 family of microcontrollers, including the ESP32-WROOM-32 and ESP-CAM modules.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of experimental code for the ESP32 family. The primary goal of this project is to develop an embedded AI application capable of facial recognition. The application aims to identify faces and crawl the internet for similar images or faces.

## Features

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Utilized for its powerful processing capabilities and low power consumption.
- **ESP-CAM Module**: Integrated camera module for capturing images.
- **Facial Recognition**: Implementing AI algorithms to recognize and match faces.
- **Web Crawling**: Searching the web for similar images or faces.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - ESP32 Development Board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32)
  - ESP-CAM Module
  - Power Supply
  - Cables and Connectors

- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE
  - ESP32 Board Package for Arduino
  - OpenCV or similar library for AI and facial recognition
  - Python (for web crawling)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Set Up Arduino IDE**:
   - Install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Add the ESP32 board support to Arduino IDE. Follow the instructions [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).

2. **Connect ESP-CAM Module**:
   - Connect the ESP-CAM to your ESP32 development board using the appropriate GPIO pins.
   - Power up the module and ensure the connections are secure.

3. **Upload Sample Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port.
   - Upload the sample code provided in the `examples/` directory of this repository.

4. **Run Facial Recognition Algorithm**:
   - Use the provided Python scripts or OpenCV to process images and identify faces.
   - Execute the web crawling script to search for similar images or faces on the internet.
